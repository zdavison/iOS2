Due Date
--------------------
15th May 2015

Requirements
--------------------

- A user interface that can visually represent a game of Solitaire.
- Faculties to play a full game of Solitaire, including logic declaring victory.
- A scoreboard that saves scores (number of moves, names) using Core Data.

Notes
-------------------

- Your game should be playable with a sensible interface. This should be a touch interface for almost all functions, allowing you to drag and drop cards. However, should you have a better idea, I will reward ingenuity.
- Your interface should be visually pleasing. Make it look nice, it makes a difference.
- You can choose not to use Core Data for scorekeeping, but there will be a mark penalty.

Grading
------------------

- 25% of marks are for visually representing the game of Solitaire accurately.
- 10% of marks are for providing the ability to interact with the cards appropriately (eg: move cards from stack to stack, etc)
- 30% of marks are for providing the logic to play the game of Solitaire.
- 15% of marks are for saving scores using Core Data.
- 15% of marks are for visual style and user interface design.
- 5% of marks are for sensible and clean code.

Rules
--------

You may use online libraries, resources, and tools to help you with your assignment. You may make use of any 3rd or 1st party libraries you wish. The only thing you may not do is copy code wholesale from the internet. I understand that an amount of code may be similar to resources you consulted online, and this is no problem, but large scale plagiarism will be dealt with drastically and may result in a mark of 0, or worse, disciplinary action from the exam board.

Resources
------------------
- You can find a set of 52 playing cards in .png and vector format [here](http://code.google.com/p/vector-playing-cards/), but you are free to represent the cards in any way you like.

Submission
--------

Please create a **seperate** repository on your GitHub account, and call it 'Solitaire'. Push your code to GitHub, including any dependencies / READMEs / info required to run, and email a link to **zac@getdrop.com** with the subject `DIT iOS Assignment 2015`.
